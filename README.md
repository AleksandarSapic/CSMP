## Overview

This project involves the development of a React single-page application (SPA) designed for the CSMP (Continuous System Modeling Program) simulation language. The application provides an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface where users can easily select, position, and connect various mathematical function blocks—such as sine (sin), cosine (cos), and exponential (exp)—to create and simulate complex systems. The goal is to offer a visual programming environment that simplifies system creation and simulation through the use of predefined function blocks, making it accessible for users to model continuous systems efficiently.
